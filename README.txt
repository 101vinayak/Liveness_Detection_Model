The Following steps are to be followed to replicate the results:

1. use the face_data.py file to save FACE images with their respective names.
2. use the temp.py file to make LIVE and NOT-LIVE dataset by changing folder names.(all the different individuals need to show face for some time in live, and theirs pics in not-live together).
3. Use the liveness detection file and follow teh steps, load the weights etc to check for results.
4. The more diverse the dataset the better results.
